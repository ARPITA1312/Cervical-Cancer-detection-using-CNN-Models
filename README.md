# Cervical Cancer Detection Using Pretrained Models and U-Net Integration with explainable AI
When applying deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to the task of cervical cancer detection using Pap smear images, researchers often compare a variety of architectures to balance accuracy, speed, and computational resource requirements.

This repository contains the complete pipeline for preprocessing Pap smear images for cervical cancer detection. We utilized several state-of-the-art pretrained models, including ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, and InceptionV3, to classify cervical cell images. Through extensive experimentation, we identified ResNet50 as the most effective model for this task.

To further enhance the segmentation and feature extraction capabilities, we integrated ResNet50 with a U-Net architecture, allowing for improved localization and representation learning. Finally, we employed Grad-CAM to provide explainability by visualizing important regions in the images that contribute to the classification decisions.

Key Features:
‚úÖ Pap smear image preprocessing for better feature extraction
‚úÖ Comparison of multiple pretrained models for classification
‚úÖ ResNet50 + U-Net integration for enhanced segmentation and detection
‚úÖ Grad-CAM visualizations for interpretability and trust in model predictions

This work aims to contribute to the field of explainable AI in medical imaging, providing a robust and interpretable approach for cervical cancer detection. üöÄ‚ú®
